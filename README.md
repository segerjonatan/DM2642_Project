Titel: Suburban Outfitters

* A simple shopping page where the content will be clothing. The user will 
have the ability to buy different items in one go. The service will be based on two categories for clothes; trending products and most popular products. 

* The basics of the interface are in place (the skeleton). Login is in place. The website currently uses an API with dishes because we are familiar 
with this API. It currently handles API calls. The API will be changed to the Best Buy API which will generate clothing items.

* Implementing the Best Buy API, customize the trending products and the most popular products functions.
